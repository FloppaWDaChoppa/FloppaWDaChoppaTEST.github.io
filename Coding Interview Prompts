## How will you continue learning about computer science?
I can continue learning about computer science by using the online resources I have been working with throughout this course such as Khan Academy and Codecademy. 
Alternatively, I can seek out other online educational options to further expand my knowledge and understanding of computer science. As technology advances and our lives become more immersed and connected with it, it is increasingly important to learn about computer science because this knowledge will prove to be a useful tool in the future and become a siginifant part of our lives. With the rapid emergence and development of new technology, learning about computer science gives me beneficial skills and can help me find employment in software, hardware, consumer electronics, robotics and other growing technology-related industries more easily.

## Summarize your experience with Khan Academy.
My experience with khan academy was a satisfactory experience overall, however I do have some complaints and criticisms. On one hand I enjoyed Khan Academy's learning structure complete with practice exercises, instructional videos, and even a personalized learning dashboard for students to easily navigate, keep track of progress and set goals. However, I personally found it very hard to keep my momentum when I was working with Khan Academy as it lacked a lot of engagement and did not really have any means of encouraging or motivating students to keep working. It felt like my learning was just a checklist. I did not enjoy using it as a learning tool as it lacks the capability to keep students interested with their instructional format of reading articles then straight onto application whilst expanding of the items your just read and learned about. It is frustrating and not a very effective learning procedure. However, it does get the job done and taught me all the basic fundamentals concepts and applications of Javascript in computer science.

## What does it mean to have good programming practices?
Having good programming practices means being mindful of your code and it's structure. This entails the efficiency and organization of your code in terms of readability for your peers and/or teachers as well as the execution of your code. It is crucial to have well written, organized and efficient code such that it is easy to read so that you can easily identify errors and for yourself and others to understand your code. Well written, organized and efficient code is also important in the sense that your code is properly structured so that it is easy to refactor and improve. In my experience, my programming practice can use work on very simple mistakes like mal-nesting, documentation and indentation; small, nit-picky things but they add up and when you are coding, especially if your mind is unorganized and scattered as your code will reflect that and it can get messy really quick.
