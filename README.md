## How will you continue learning about computer science?
I can continue learning about computer science by using the online resources I have been working with throughout this course such as Khan Academy and Codecademy. I can alternatively seek out other online educational options to further expand my knowledge and understanding of computer science. As technology advances and our lives become more immersed and connected with it, it is increasingly important to learn about computer science because this knowledge will prove to be a useful tool in the future and become a siginifant part of our lives. 

## Summarize your experience with Khan Academy.
My experience with khan academy was a satisfactory experience overall, however I do have some negative criticisms. On one hand I enjoyed Khan Academy's learning structure complete with practice exercises, instructional videos, and even a personalized learning dashboard for students to easily navigate, keep track of progress and set goals. However, I personally found it very hard to keep my momentum when I was working with Khan Academy as it lacked a lot of engagement and did not really have any means of encouraging or motivating students to keep working. It felt like my learning was just a checklist. I did not enjoy using it as a learning tool as it lacks the capability to keep students interested with their instructional format of reading articles then straight onto application whilst expanding of the items your just read and learned about. It is frustrating and not a very effective learning procedure.

## What does it mean to have good programming practices?
